#DOBStats
### Date of Birth stats across a mysql record set

This is a simple PHP and MySQL app which uses PDO and PHP Iterator to traverse and filter a record set one record at a time, yet in a very performant manner. The ideas and examples presented hear are akin to the raw SQL access methods used by most popular PHP frameworks.

The idea for this example was taken from DragonBe's blog and the article [Speeding up Database Calls with PDO](http://www.dragonbe.com/2015/07/speeding-up-database-calls-with-pdo-and.html). See his article for more information.
